Fires in NYC and FDNY Response
================================






```r
fire_all <- read_csv("severe_incidents.csv") 
fire_all$year <- substr(fire_all$INCIDENT_DATE_TIME, 7, 10)
fire <- fire_all%>% 
  filter(HIGHEST_LEVEL_DESC == "7 - Signal 7-5") %>%
  filter(year==2015)
```




```r
library(ggmap)
library(stringr)

# Make list of addresses
address <- str_c( str_to_title(fire$STREET_HIGHWAY),
                  "New York, NY",
                  fire$ZIP_CODE,
                  sep=", ")

# Register Google API Key
register_google(key = Sys.getenv("AIzaSyDSJJNXtkxvcO23YnZ9COQotZRvD5g5Wx8"))

# Geocode Addresses
latlong <- geocode(address, output = c("latlon"))

# Merge on
fire$Latitude  <- latlong$lat
fire$Longitude <- latlong$lon

# Save File
write_csv(fire, "severe_incidents.csv")
```

#### FDNY Firehouse Listing

NYC Open Data also provides data on the [location of all 218 firehouses in NYC](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/FDNY-Firehouse-Listing/hc8x-tcnd). Relevant for our analysis are the following variables:

    FacilityName, Borough, Latitude, Longitude

## Tasks

#### 1. Location of Severe Fires

Provide a `leaflet` map of the severe fires contained in the file `severe_incidents.csv`. Ignore locations that fall outside the five boroughs of New York City. Provide at least three pieces of information on the incident in a popup. 

```r
library(leaflet)
library(tidyverse)

#load fire icon from online
fireIcons <- icons(
  iconUrl = "https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/240/facebook/111/fire_1f525.png",
  iconWidth = 15, iconHeight = 15,
  iconAnchorX = 7.5, iconAnchorY = 8.5
  )

#read csv 
fire <- read.csv("severe_incidents.csv")
m <- leaflet(fire) %>% 
     addTiles('http://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png') %>%
     setView(-73.9159344, 40.771, zoom = 13)

#popup content
content <- paste("Where:",fire$STREET_HIGHWAY,"<br/>",
                 "When:",fire$INCIDENT_DATE_TIME,"<br/>",
                 "Units on scene:",fire$UNITS_ONSCENE,"<br/>",
                 "What:",fire$INCIDENT_TYPE_DESC,"<br/>",
                 "Type of Property: ", fire$PROPERTY_USE_DESC, "<br/>")
m %>% addMarkers(icon = fireIcons, popup = content)  #add icons to map
```

```
## Assuming 'Longitude' and 'Latitude' are longitude and latitude, respectively
```

#### 2. Layers and Clusters

##### a) Color by Type of Property

Start with the previous map. Now, distinguish the markers of the fire locations by `PROPERTY_USE_DESC`, i.e. what kind of property was affected. If there are too many categories, collapse some categories. Choose an appropriate coloring scheme to map the locations by type of affected property. Add a legend informing the user about the color scheme. Also make sure that the information about the type of affected property is now contained in the popup information. Show this map.

##### b) Cluster

Add marker clustering, so that zooming in will reveal the individual locations but the zoomed out map only shows the clusters. Show the map with clusters.

```r
mc <- m %>%
     setView(-73.9159344, 40.771, zoom = 11)

#add clusters
mclust <- mc %>% addCircleMarkers(color = color_prop,

```

```
## Assuming 'Longitude' and 'Latitude' are longitude and latitude, respectively

#### 3. Fire Houses

The second data file contains the locations of the 218 firehouses in New York City. Start with the non-clustered map (2b) and now adjust the size of the circle markers by severity (`TOTAL_INCIDENT_DURATION` or `UNITS_ONSCENE` seem plausible options). More severe incidents should have larger circles on the map. On the map, also add the locations of the fire houses. Add two layers ("Incidents", "Firehouses") that allow the user to select which information to show. 

```r
dep <- read_csv("FDNY_Firehouse_Listing.csv")

## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(

##   FacilityAddress = col_character(),
##   Borough = col_character(),
##   Postcode = col_integer(),
##   Latitude = col_double(),
##   Longitude = col_double(),
##   `Community Board` = col_integer(),
##   `Community Council` = col_integer(),
##   `Census Tract` = col_integer(),
##   BIN = col_integer(),
##   BBL = col_double(),
##   NTA = col_character()

#### 4. Distance from Firehouse and Response Time

We now want to investigate whether the distance of the incident from the nearest firehouse varies across the city. 

##### a) Calculate Distance

For all incident locations, identify the nearest firehouse and calculate the distance between the firehouse and the incident location. Provide a scatter plot showing the time until the first engine arrived (the variables `INCIDENT_DATE_TIME` and `ARRIVAL_DATE_TIME`) will be helpful. If there are any interesting patterns to highlight, feel free to do so.

#Most incidents within 2km of stations. Response time variance seems similar across all boroughs. Staten Island and
#Queens seem to have more incidents that were further away from fire stations. Incidents in Manhattan seem to all
#have stations that are closeby. Maybe because it is the most densely populated area.

##### b) Map of Response Times

Provide a map visualization of response times. Feel free to differentiate by incident type / property affected etc. if that is interesting.
